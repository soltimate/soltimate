// The css structure is based on CSS architecture model SMACSS. The model is based on categorization. We categorize the rules into separate blocks that are easier to handle.
// In SMACSS there are 5 categories: Base, Layout, Module, State and Theme. For scss purposes we will also add settings and functions.
//
// Read more about SMACSS at https://smacss.com/book/categorizing


// On top of the architecture there is also list of good practices guiding the produced css.
// 1. For transparency, use rgba. Otherwise, always use the hexadecimal format.
// 2. Favor transitions over animations. Only animate opacity and transform.
// 3. Use unitless values when possible.
// 4. Favor rem over em. And try to keep away from px related rules when possible.
// 5. Prefer seconds over milliseconds.


// First we import the settings.
@import "CssSettings";

// Next we import the sass functions that will be used later.
@import "ScssFunctions";

// Next we import all of the SMACSS parts in their preferred order.
@import "Base";
@import "Layout";
@import "Module";
@import "State";
@import "Theme";
